//    original one) has passed CRC check. The user must reset this bit.

//    stored inside the sensor. If this bit does not come to zero 2s after the
//    sensor has been plugged in, there is a problem with the sensor's calibra-
//    tion data.

// If either watch dog barks, the sensor data is not beig receive correctly.
